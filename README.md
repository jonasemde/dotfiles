# Jonas dotfiles

My personal dotfiles. Also used by nearly all other geeks at [mindtwo.de](https://www.mindtwo.de) 

You can install them by cloning the repository as '.dotfiles' in your homedirectory and running the bootstrap-script.

The bootstrap script can be run be cd-ing into the .dotfiles directory and performing this command:
```bash
./bootstrap
```
